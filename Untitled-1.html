    <h1>Allama Iqbal</h1>
    <p>
      Allama Muhammad Iqbal, born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot, is celebrated
      as one of the most influential poets and philosophers of the 20th century.
      Often referred to as the "Spiritual Father of Pakistan," Iqbal played a
      crucial role in inspiring the movement for a separate Muslim state in
      British India. Iqbalâ€™s education in Lahore and Europe profoundly shaped
      his worldview, blending Western thought with Eastern spirituality. His
      poetry, primarily written in Urdu and Persian, emphasizes themes of
      self-awareness, spiritual awakening, and social justice. Notable works
      such as "Shikwa" and "Jawab-e-Shikwa" articulate the challenges faced by
      Muslims, urging them to reclaim their identity and potential. In addition
      to his literary contributions, Iqbal was an advocate for political change.
      He was instrumental in the Lahore Resolution of 1940, which called for the
      establishment of Pakistan. His vision encompassed a democratic and
      progressive society rooted in Islamic values. Iqbal passed away on April
      21, 1938, but his legacy endures. His ideas continue to resonate in
      contemporary discussions of identity and nationalism, making him a central
      figure in both Pakistani literature and history. Iqbal Day is observed
      annually on November 9 to honor his contributions.
